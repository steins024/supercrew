# Log Progress

## Overview

Append a progress entry to the active feature's `log.md`. This creates a chronological record of work done across sessions.

## When to Use

- At the end of a coding session (before the user leaves)
- After completing one or more tasks from `plan.md`
- When encountering a significant blocker or making a key decision
- When the `managing-features` skill prompts you to log

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Session Context

Automatically collect from the current session:

1. **What was worked on** — summarize the main activities (files changed, features implemented, bugs fixed)
2. **Tasks completed** — which `plan.md` tasks were checked off this session
3. **Issues encountered** — any blockers, unexpected problems, or decisions made
4. **Next steps** — what should be done in the next session

### Step 2: Append to `log.md`

Add a new entry at the **end** of the file (entries are chronological):

```markdown
## <YYYY-MM-DD> — <Brief summary of session>

### Completed
- <what was accomplished>
- <tasks completed from plan>

### Issues
- <any blockers or problems encountered>
- (none if no issues)

### Next Steps
- <what to do next session>
```

### Step 3: Update Metadata

- Update `meta.yaml` `updated` date to today

### Step 4: Commit and Push to Remote

1. Commit the updated `log.md` and `meta.yaml` to the feature branch (`feature/<id>`)
2. Push to `origin/feature/<id>` so the kanban (SessionStart hook) reflects the change

If already on the feature branch, commit and push directly. If on another branch, checkout the feature branch, commit, push, then return to the original branch.

## Rules

- **Never overwrite** existing log entries — always **append**
- Keep entries concise but informative (someone reading the log should understand the feature's journey)
- If no issues were encountered, write "None" under Issues
- Always include Next Steps to give context for the next session
